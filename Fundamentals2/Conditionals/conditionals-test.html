    <!-- * Conditionals Test 1 -->
    <!-- 
        ? Procedure

        * 1. Add 'season' variable that says what is the current season 
        * 2. Add 'response' variable that is uninitialized 
        * 3. Check if 'season' contains the string of 'summer' and 'winter'. If so, assigned an appropriate message to the user using the 'response' variable 
        * 4. If not, assigned a generic string on 'response' that tells the user we don't know that season it is.

    <!-- * Conditionals Test 2 -->
    <!-- 
        ? Procedure

        * 1. Add 'machineActive' that contains an indicator of true or false.
        * 2. Add 'score' contains the imaginary score of a game.
        * 3. Add 'response' uninitialized, used to store the user input. 
        * 4. If..else structure whether the switch is on or the 'response' is not valid and telling the user to switch the machine on.
        * 5. Nest if..else if...else that puts appropriate message into the 'response' depending on what value the score is, if only the machine is turned on. 

        ? The procedure on different conditionals tests (when the score is evaluating)

        * Score of less than 0 or more than 100 — "This is not possible, an error has occurred."
        * Score of 0 to 19 — "That was a terrible score — total fail!"
        * Score of 20 to 39 — "You know some things, but it\'s a pretty bad score. Needs improvement."
        * Score of 40 to 69 — "You did a passable job, not bad!"
        * Score of 70 to 89 — "That\'s a great score, you really know your stuff."
        * Score of 90 to 100 — "What an amazing score! Did you cheat? Are you for real?"
